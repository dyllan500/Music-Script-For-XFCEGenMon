# Music-Script-For-XFCEGenMon
A script I made to get Spotify song being player and display it on XFCE Panel
The script is very hacky mostly becuase of my lack of C knowledge. The script works as I want to though. It displays the song you are playing in a rainbow of colors on the XFCE panel using the Generic Monitor.
Only bug I have found so far is it displaying "No Players Found" on its own when no music player is opened. Trying to fix that to display whatever I want.

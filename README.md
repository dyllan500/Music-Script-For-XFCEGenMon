# Music-Script-For-XFCEGenMon

Dependency: playerctl

A script I made to get Spotify song being player and display it on XFCE Panel
The script is very hacky mostly becuase of my lack of C knowledge. The script works as I want to though. It displays the song you are playing in a rainbow of colors on the XFCE panel using the Generic Monitor.
Some some tiles/artists causes the program to stop on previous song it is because a character like & break it. I have replaced some of the problem characters I have found with a * till I find a way to fix it.
